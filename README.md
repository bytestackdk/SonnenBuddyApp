## Ionic app for iOS and Android

This is an Ionic app for iOS and Android using Capacitor and Angular. Initially available for iOS and Android. Due to lack of maintenance, it has been removed from Google Play by Google, but still exists on the AppStore... for now.

AppStore: https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/sonnen-buddy/id1627198189

I'm happy with the feature set of the app still, but could find ways to improve the existing functionality and code base. Also there has been some feature requests by the users, that's also worth considering.

The future of the app is unsure, as there's some effort involved in updating the dependencies of the app, setting up CI/CD in AppFlow again, building a new version and deploying it. It also needs to adhere to any new rules and regulations of the stores.

For now though, the source code is available for anyone that's curious. It can run in your browser if you clone the app and just run it locally.
